## Setup

### Uses Python3
#### Create the virtual environment
1. Open your terminal in the project directory and run:
      `python -m venv venv`
This creates a new directory named venv that contains an isolated Python environment.
2. Activate the virtual environment

   On macOS/Linux, run: 

         source venv/bin/activate

   On Windows, run:

         venv\Scripts\activate

   When activated, your terminal prompt should change to show the name of the virtual environment.

3. Install project dependencies

   With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages by running:

         pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Deactivate the virtual environment

   When youâ€™re finished working, simply run:

         deactivate

## Running Code

If using VScode or any ide, simply click `Run Python File`

If on terminal, naivgate to project directory and run:

      python reccomender.py

Then once the prompt `Query:` appears, enter a query and press enter.

## Results
